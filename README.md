🚀 **Empowering Prevention: Predicting Diabetes Risk with Machine Learning!** 🩺📊

I'm excited to share my Capstone Project, where I developed a Personalized Diabetes Risk Forecast using Machine Learning & Data Science! 🧑‍💻 This project aimed to predict an individual's likelihood of developing diabetes based on various health indicators, helping drive preventive healthcare decisions.

🔍 Key Highlights:

✔ Data Preprocessing – Handled imbalanced data with SMOTE, scaled features with StandardScaler, and engineered features using OneHotEncoder.

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualized health trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

✔ Model Training & Evaluation – Compared multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, KNN, Gradient Boosting) to identify the best-performing model.

✔ Hyperparameter Tuning – Implemented GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV for optimal model selection.

✔ Performance Metrics – Evaluated models using ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall for better interpretability.
